A browser for segmentation datasets.
Follows the VOC semantic segmentation organization.

Version 1.1 December 2013.
Developed by Joao Carreira.

A minor change from 1.0 that I can remember was adding a function that returns the ids of truncated and occluded segments. 
Maybe there were a few others, nothing very important.
